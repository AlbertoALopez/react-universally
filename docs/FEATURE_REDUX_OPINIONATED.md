# Redux - Opinionated

This is a feature branch of `react-universally` that is up to with version `v12.0.0`.

It provides you with an opinionated implementation of redux with simple custom data prefetching technique that works for the server and client.  Additionally it merges in the `feature/flow` branch so that we can use Flow types to declare the Redux actions.

__NOTE: I am in the process of creating a new library that will replace the custom task routes mechanism that is present within this repository.  It will solve lots of issues we have had with the routing mechanism, and shouldn't be hard to migrate to.__
